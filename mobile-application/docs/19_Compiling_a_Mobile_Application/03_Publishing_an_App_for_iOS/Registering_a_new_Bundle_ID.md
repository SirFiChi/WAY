Once you're on the **Registering an App ID** page, then:

1. Under `App ID Description`, enter the name of your App
2. Under `App ID Prefix`, your team should automatically be selected, if it isn't select the option, e.g. "######## (Team ID)"
3. Under `App ID Suffix` select the `Explicit App ID` radio button, then enter your desired `Bundle ID` name into the text field
4. Under `App Services` select which services will be available for your App. By default the `Game Center` and `In-App Purchase` check boxes will be checked.

Click the **Continue** button

On the next screen you'll be at the **Confirm your App ID** page, review the information summarized and if everything looks good, hit the **Submit** button
