># What's the difference between a mobile application and a web application?

A mobile application is downloaded by the user (typically from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/)) and installed directly onto their mobile device. Once installed, the user can launch the app from a shortcut on their phone.

On the other hand, a web application is similar to a mobile website in that it is designed to work in modern browsers on any device (mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops). This means a user can simply visit a URL in their web browser (on any device, any size), and the application will run for them.
