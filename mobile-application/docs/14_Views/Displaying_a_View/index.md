After creating a [Views JSON Page Display](Creating_a_Views_JSON), there are a few ways we can display a view inside of our app. To take advantage of built in DrupalGap features for Views (data fetching, paging, etc) use the **Render Array** technique. Otherwise, it's possible to manually retrieve and display Views results.

- [Views Render Array](Displaying_a_View/Views_Render_Array)
- [Manually Display View](Displaying_a_View/Manually_Display_View)
