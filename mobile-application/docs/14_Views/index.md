## Views Datasource (Views JSON)

Our mobile application may need to be able to consume JSON data from our Drupal site. Using the **Views JSON** sub module available in the [Views Datasource](https://drupal.org/project/views_datasource) module, we can easily take result data from a Drupal View and make it available as JSON for our application. DrupalGap is dependant on this module, so you should have it already installed on your site.

Try [creating an example Views JSON](Views/Creating_a_Views_JSON), then displaying it on a page in your app.
